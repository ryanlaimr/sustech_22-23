# SUSTech Year 1 Materials

This GitHub Repo includes the relevant materials of courses I have taken in AY22/23 in SUSTech, before I moved to Singapore and transferred to NUS.

I took Calculus I, Linear Algebra, and Introduction to Python Programming in AY22/23 Semester 1; Calculus II, Advanced Linear Algebra, and Macroeconomics in AY22/23 Semester 2.

You may access the lecture slides, my notes, past year papers, and some assignments in each folder.
