# SUSTech Year 1 Materials

[[back]][back] [[Home]][home]

This [GitHub Repo][repo] includes the relevant materials of courses I have taken in AY22/23 in SUSTech, before I moved to Singapore and transferred to NUS.

I took [Calculus I][calc1], [Linear Algebra][la], and [Introduction to Python Programming][py] in AY22/23 Semester 1; [Calculus II][calc2], [Advanced Linear Algebra][ala], and [Macroeconomics][econ] in AY22/23 Semester 2.

You may access the lecture slides, my notes, past year papers, and some assignments in each folder of this [Repo][repo].

You can [contact me][email] at laizy2022@mail.sustech.edu.cn.
